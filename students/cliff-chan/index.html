        <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="heavy">Hometown:</span> Vancouver, BC</p>
        <p>Prior to coming to RED, I worked full time at Apple. I am now a part time employee and will be spending most of my
          time here! I am super excited.</p>
        <h2>Interesting Fact About Me</h2>
        <p>I recently discovered my passion for spicy foods. I have spent the last year building my spice tolerance and I am
          now proud to say that I can eat really really spicy foods!</p>
        <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
        <p>This past June, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan for 16 days. The best part of this experience was that I was by myself
          the entire time! I met some really cool people along the way and had lots of great food. This was my first time
          traveling solo and I highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't done it before.</p>
        <h2>Big Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to gain the best training possible and land a job that I enjoy and will dedicate my life to. This will
          be all I do for the next six months and I am 100% ready to tackle any obstacles along the way.</p>

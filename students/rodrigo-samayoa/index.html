            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I originally came to Vancouver from Guatemala 9 years ago to study, but stayed for the mountains, the city and the people. </p>
                <p>Over the past 5 years, I have been working for non-profits and unions on digital campaigns pushing for progressive policy at the provincial and federal level. I have worked on a number of issues ranging from repealing Bill C-51 to stopping the Kinder Morgan pipeline with organizations like Leadnow and Sum of Us.</p>
                <p>I currently work at the BCGEU as a digital campaigner, running public policy campaigns for the union.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>climbing</li>
                    <li>hiking</li>
                    <li>skiing</li>
                    <li>mountaineering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nothing inspires me more than exploring wild spaces with the people I love. </p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>  
            <div class="content">   
                <p>After this course I will continue working at the BCGEU as a digital campaigner, but wish to start shifting my focus to the tech side of my job. Over time, I would like to gain enough skills to be able to move to Northern BC and work from abroad so I can explore the vast wilderness in Northern Canada. </p>

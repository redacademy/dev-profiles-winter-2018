             <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>

             <p>I got to meet one of my wife's friends who was a famous screen writer. 
                 We stayed in her house for 2 days. 2 whole days of karaoke, unlimited food (must be nice to be rich) and 
                never ending one liners.</p>

            <h2>Goal</h2>

            <p>After graduation I hope to work freelance or pursue self-employment in the related field. This will allow me to
                travel and move more freely so I can still support my family's needs.

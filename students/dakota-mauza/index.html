                <h4>Life Before RED</h4>
                <p>Before enrolling at RED, I've had a mixture of school and work. I completed two years of undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Alberta. Afterward, I got swept up by the busyness of work and spent the next few years in sales.</p>
                <h4>All About Me</h4>
                <p>Born and raised in Vancouver, and after spending time in other cities it's still my favourite city in the world. I'm mostly a homebody but I love the outdoors, when I'm not on my computer you'll find me in the middle of the forest. I started coding simple HTML websites when I was in elementary school and it took off from there.</p>
                <h4>What I Want To Do</h4>
                <p>After graduating from RED I hope to get a job on a team of other developers to help gain further experience in the industry, then possibly move on to my own projects. I'd also love to have the time to travel to Europe or Asia, maybe be able to work from a remote position.</p>

        <h2 class="center border">BEFORE RED</h2>
        <p>I am currently a 2nd year business student at Simon Fraser University. I have long planned taking time off school in 2018 to pursue personal goals. One of the goals I set for myself this year, which is why I specifically chose RED academy, is to further my knowledge in web-development to help my transition into a computer science major at Simon Fraser university.</p>
        <h2 class="center border">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am an active member of the Ultimate Frisbee community in Vancouver, and have been playing the sport for 6 years. I am currently working part-time for the Vancouver Ultimate League as a youth coach (check out an image of me <a href="https://www.vul.ca/content/fall-u14-skills">here!</a>). I also founded and coach the Templeton Secondary ultimate team.</p>
        <p>Although I enjoy having an active lifestyle, what I love just as much is a relaxing night playing Magic: the Gathering with friends. I have been an avid Magic player and collector since I was 10 years old, and always try to reserve 1 day each month to join in on small tournaments at my local game store.
